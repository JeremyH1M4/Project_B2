I work on our choice game in second period and this project is a game where you determine your fate! We will use mostly javascript to make the game, but we will also use html and css a little but. I feel like Im more in charge of the base line of this game, setting up the javascript for my teamates to fill out the rest and give the game more charcter. I will just do my work and try and communinicate the best I can.
